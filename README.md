# StudentSync
StudentSync is a simple app designed to help students manage their tasks and quizzes. It includes a to-do list feature and a quiz function to assist with learning. Developed in Swift using Xcode, it provides a straightforward interface for organizing school-related activities. This is my first-time experimenting with the Swift Language.
